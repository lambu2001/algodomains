First i created the domain  model
then created repository class on the user entities 
then created controller to implement the actual business logic
if product.isPresent(), a 200 ok HTTP response is returned 
to run the application use mvn spring-boot:run
now springboot REST API is running on http://localhost:8585
to get the final price as require output u provided an HTTP GET request go to http://localhost:8585/product/1001 from browser it will display the desired JSON response
